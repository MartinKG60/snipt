        <!-- What Makes Snipt Different Section -->
        <section class="policy-section">
            <h2>What Makes Snipt Different</h2>
            <p>
                In a market filled with screenshot tools, Snipt stands out by focusing on what IT professionals and everyday users actually need:
            </p>

            <h3>Built by Someone Who Uses It</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike generic screenshot tools, Snipt was built by someone who daily understands the pain of digital communication. Every feature has been carefully chosen based on real-world IT support workflows and professional communication needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Respect for Your System</h3>
            <p>
                We believe software should enhance your productivity without burdening your system. Snipt is engineered to be efficient, fast, and lightweight—respecting your computer's resources while delivering professional results.
            </p>

            <h3>Focus on the Essentials</h3>
            <p>
                Rather than overwhelming you with hundreds of editing tools or features you'll never use, Snipt concentrates on the core: capturing what you need and sharing it effortlessly. Advanced annotation and editing features complement rather than complicate the core experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Free & Sustainable</h3>
            <p>
                Great software doesn't need to be expensive. Snipt is free because I believe productivity tools should be accessible to everyone—students, professionals, IT teams, and anyone in between.

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>What Makes Snipt Different</h2>
            <p>
                In a market filled with screenshot tools, Snipt stands out by focusing on what IT professionals and everyday users actually need:
            </p>

            <h3>Built by Someone Who Uses It</h3>
            <p>
                Unlike generic screenshot tools, Snipt was built by someone who daily understands the pain of digital communication. Every feature has been carefully chosen based on real-world IT support workflows and professional communication needs.
            </p>

            <h3>Respect for Your System</h3>
            <p>
                We believe software should enhance your productivity without burdening your system. Snipt is engineered to be efficient, fast, and lightweight—respecting your computer's resources while delivering professional results.
            </p>

            <h3>Focus on the Essentials</h3>
            <p>
                Rather than overwhelming you with hundreds of editing tools or features you'll never use, Snipt concentrates on the core: capturing what you need and sharing it effortlessly. Advanced annotation and editing features complement rather than complicate the core experience.
            </p>

            <h3>Free & Sustainable</h3>
            <p>
                Great software doesn't need to be expensive. Snipt is free because I believe productivity tools should be accessible to everyone—students, professionals, IT teams, and anyone in between.
